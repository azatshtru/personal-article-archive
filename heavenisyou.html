<p>Ricocheting through the walls of misery is your ecstasy <br>
 <br>
    They say that heaven is pure <br>
    I rather know it to be tainted by thy sweet venom <br>
     <br>
    For I have seen the halls of heaven <br>
    For I have seen god's devilish playground <br>
     <br>
    For heaven was never soft as they say <br>
    For heaven was never safe as they say <br>
    It was vigorous <br>
    It was violent <br>
     <br>
    They told me that heaven had assembly <br>
    Your echoed screams of indulgence shattered it <br>
     <br>
    The heaven lost its kindness long ago <br>
    The heaven lost its forgiveness long ago <br>
    I know it to be cruel <br>
    I know it to be unjust <br>
     <br>
    For heaven has no soul of the archfiend <br>
    Yet I know two souls to be sinful <br>
     <br>
    For their love breeds the sin <br>
    And the sin destroys the assembly <br>
    And the assembly holds your venom <br>
    And your venom corrupts the heaven <br>
     <br>
    The pride of owning a soul <br>
    The greed to own it more <br>
    The wrath to conquer it too <br>
    The envy when another pierces through <br>
    The lust that explores thy visage's hue <br>
    The gluttony that devours your miasmic mu <br>
    The sloth of love that never lets you move <br>
     <br>
    The filth spread and morality withdrew <br>
    Perfection is lost and it's fall, I brew <br>
    Leave I must, but the warfare is due <br>
    A battle of souls I'm destined to lose  <br>
    Leave I can't, for the passion weakens my soul <br>
    Love serves with lies <br>
    Lust serves with the truth <br>
    A defeat I must accept <br>
    A victory I must let go <br>
    To lose is what I want <br>
    To win against my desire is to suffer through <br>
    Cause I am addicted to your filth <br>
    For heaven is you. <br>
