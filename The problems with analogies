The problems with analogies and the possible ways to fix them

It's pretty straightforward. We have a tendency to compare humans to cakes (or pizzas), that until a cake is somewhat full, it won’t share its piece to someone else. <br> <br>

Or to the sun, the way it burns itself to give light to the solar system. <br> <br>

To rocks, to the ocean, to a half glass of water, that you are half empty <i> but still half full </i>. We compare humans to animals like alligators who fake cry or dog tails that never get straight (this is not a gay joke). <br> <br>

We even compare humans to human-made things like “A man is but a sword, the more heat and beating he takes, the more sharp he becomes.” <br> <br>

To abstract ideas that a human is an idea slash an emotion slash a conflict, etc. <br> <br>

We compare life to highways, eyes to diamonds. We beat dead horses and punch the water. Sometimes these metaphors are conflicting: “Love is a disease that knows no laws” but “Love is a cure to a rotten, unpeaceful mind”. <br> <br>

The problem is in the core, we aren’t cakes or pajamas, or dogs or alligators or diseases or cures or shields or swords. <br> <br>

A human is complex, more complex than the sun. Not everyone needs to “burn” or lose parts of themselves to give to others like the sun does. The sun doesn’t feel pain, we humans do. It’s ok to stop giving for some time and compose yourself. We cannot be defined by objects and animals and abstract ideas, some of us might share some traits with them, but these analogies do not define the very character of the situations. A human does not need to be an ocean and contain every kind of toxicity and pain but still keep flowing. The ocean doesn’t write SATs and APs. The ocean doesn’t feel grief of losing a loved one, we do. A human can never be an ocean or the sun, the ocean can never be human. <br> <br>

This is not always bad and helps humans cope with situations when we compare those situations to physical or abstract non-human concepts. The problem arises when we become too attached to the metaphor we used for ourselves long ago. We begin forcing ourselves to be the sword that cuts through everything and when we can’t cut through everything, we feel bad and identity-less. Using rigid metaphors takes out the fluidity of what a human can feel. You might feel like a sword today, you will feel like a shield tomorrow, a feather the day after. <br> <br>

We begin forcing ourselves to be like a certain object or animal or idea. It is important to realize that a human is more complex than that, taking out the humanity from the equation can get toxic really fast. Let your ideas and beliefs change with situations, with moments, do not force yourself to be something non-human, be everything, every belief, because having free will means you have the fluidity to experience and feel like a sword and a shield and the sun and the ocean and the light and the dark at the same time. Realizing this liberated me from setting up made-up boundaries for myself. Become everything, all at once.
