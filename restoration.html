It is green here.<br>
Greener than it was<br>
when they were.<br>
As greener as it used to be,<br>
before they were.<br><br>

The old green springed after birth,<br>
But the newer, after death.<br><br>

It is cold here.<br>
Colder than it was<br>
when they were.<br>
As colder as it used to be<br>
before they were.<br><br>

The old winter ended after them,<br>
And their end brought the new one.<br><br>

It is dark here.<br>
Darker than it was<br>
when they were.<br>
As darker as it used to be<br>
before they were.<br><br>

The old darkness was lit by their fires,<br>
The same fires brought the darkness back.<br><br>

It is silent here.<br>
Silent than it was<br>
when they were.<br>
Much silent than it used to be<br>
before they were.<br><br>

Their music, so melodious it conquered the silence.<br>
But the music is no more.<br><br>

There is nothing here.<br>
But there was,<br>
There was love and music and art.<br>
There was architecture and stories and beauty.<br>
Then there was war and death and melancholy.<br>
And then there is nothing.<br>
Their buildings, buried deep.<br>
Their stories, forgotten.<br>
Their love, destroyed by wars.<br>
Their beauty is no more.<br>
Their songs are no more.<br><br>

They... are no more.<br><br>

It is just as it used to be,<br>
before they were.<br><br>
