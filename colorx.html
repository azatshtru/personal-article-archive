In freshman year of highschool, I designed colorox. The puzzle game that was well-recieved by audiences enough to make me confident that the concept was good. <br> <br>
The prime critique was that it was too complex to understand, and that the controls and UI were a bit of the grid. <br> <br>

Below are the screenshots of my highschool colorox: <br> <br>

I held onto the idea, I've learnt a lot more about UI/UX and game design, better programming practices, shaders and everything since then. <br> <br>
I have developed and followed a philosophy of "simple to control, complex through the inherent properties, elementary shaped" design. Based on that, I decided to redesign colorox into color.x <br> <br>

color.x is a silly little puzzle game about colors and energy! where you mix colors using intelligent thinking to solve silly puzzles. <br> <br>
The art and gameplay follow the aesthetic of the ARC design. <br> <br>
Elegantly crafted levels that require you to think beyond <br> <br>
Below are the gifs of color.x (still in development, gifs do not represent the final product): <br> <br>
