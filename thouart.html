<h1> Thou art art </h1> <br>

<p>The escape to solace from reality's treason <br>
The catastrophe to the death of reason <br> <br>

The calligraphy of taos <br>
The mosaic of sufis <br> <br>

The renaissance of a corrupted sense <br>
The poetry of a broken romance <br> <br>

The maker of a thousand plays <br>
The sculptor of a million idolic clays <br> <br>

Of days the heart desires to lose its breath <br>
Of songs that rest the head till their eternal melodic conquest <br> <br>

The architecture to withhold a grim's verse <br>
The structure to serve its better part <br> <br>

You.. are art <br> <br>

The symbolism of a fable <br>
The randomness of a machine <br>
The abstraction of the numbers <br>
The surrealism of a melancholic dream <br> <br>

A dead dream lives to see the fate of its dreamer <br>
It's a fading dance to a massacred heart <br> <br>

You.. are art <br> <br>

The aroma of an aged wine <br>
The build of a sage's shrine <br> <br>

The texture of victorian walls <br>
The colors that a lysergic enthralls <br> <br>

Harmony to peace the pieces that flow through noise <br>
The famishness a delec delicacy destroys <br> <br>

The medicine that sinks the plagues and rips misery apart <br>
The voice that composes the coordination of Decart√© <br> <br>

You.. are art <br> <br>
