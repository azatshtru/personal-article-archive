<p>The space, as significant as a speck. The <br>
Atoms in my body, they crave your touch. <br>
Never have I felt the bliss of being yours, yet the<br>
Unendurable agony of being unable to<br>
See your smile again. The<br>
Heart has its reasons. The heart<br>
Knows where the ends meet. Itâ€™s<br>
A place so unfathomable, yet as beautiful as you.<br></p>
