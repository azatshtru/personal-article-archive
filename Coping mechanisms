Coping mechanisms

Lies! Deception! Self-sabotage! <br> <br>

Lies are a way to deal with grief. Nothing can ever replace the loss of something or someone. Nothing can fill the space they left behind. After figuring out grief, through the 5 stage model and other ways, throughout the years, I have developed primarily two coping mechanisms that have helped me deceive myself to some extent to feel better. <br> <br>

<b> Nihilism </b> <br>
Nothing matters, the universe has no purpose, we humans have no purpose. Things exist for no inherent reason at all, they just exist. Whatever you do is as insignificant as whatever Albert Einstein did which is as insignificant as a supernova in some nearby galaxy. In the grand scheme of things, the inevitable heat death of the universe will wipe you out. Nothing means anything. This means you are more than a purpose. This means you do not need to give meaning to things if they hurt. You have free will to take meaning in and out of things. You do not have a purpose, just do whatever you want, whatever feels good, you do not need to walk on someone’s or society’s predefined path. Because that path is as meaningless as yours.<br> 
Because nothing matters, this means you decide for yourself what matters and what doesn’t. Failed at an exam? it doesn’t mean anything, that exam is as worthless as playing DOOM Eternal, so play DOOM Eternal instead. Go against authority, morality is not defined by the universe, do whatever you want to. Everything is worthless, the things that feel bad are as worthless as the things that feel good, so do them instead. <br>
This doesn’t solve the problem, merely a lie and distraction, will get you kicked out of places if done in extremity, but has helped me cope to some extent. <br> <br>

The thing with feeling bad is that you can’t lie about it, there is nothing that will feel good, everyday is hell. You know you are lying to yourself by saying that it’s ok or it will get better, it won’t. Atleast nothing that you do will make it better. Only time will, so until that day comes when you wake up without thinking about it, you have to keep deceiving yourself by knowing that you are deceiving yourself. Lies! Deception! and Self-sabotage! <br> <br>
<b>Sadgymming</b> <br>
The universe matters, nihilism is a lie and is worthless by its own definition, but think about everything as whole and lie, lie to yourself and keep lying, but until when? At some point the illusion will break and you will stop thinking about the heat death that is billions of years into the future and you will remember that these 80 years of your life has this period of extreme misery. And it’s ok to acknowledge that things aren’t good, it’s ok to close your eyes and say that it’s not good. Then open your eyes and breathe. Be sad, allow your emotions to overflow, kick walls, scream, but breathe. Allow yourself to be sad, blame people, blame yourself, breathe. And breathe. Go silent, look at the wall, be sad, let it take over, and let it flow, breathe. Live in the moment of misery. <br>
Then get off your house and go to the gym, be sad, do light exercise, do heavy ones, make yourself tired, let that misery turn into strength, let it flow through, breathe. <br> <br>

I usually just keep switching between these two modes until a month passes, or a year passes. Until time heals. These won’t work on everyone. I’ll make a comment box under these posts soon so that I can know about your coping mechanisms too.
